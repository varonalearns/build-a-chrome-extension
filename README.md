# Build a Chrome Extension

## Summary
This is my solution to Build a Chrome Extension lesson from The Frontend Developer Career Path that can be found on [Scrimba](https://scrimba.com/).

## What I learned
While working on this project, I learned the following:
- const
- addEventListener()
- innerHTML
- input.value
- function parameters
- template strings
- localStorage
- The JSON object
- objects in arrays

## Continued Development
I don't know what I could add to this particular project but maybe I can think of an idea for a Chrome extension.
